# OpenAgent Branding Specification

## Brand positioning

OpenAgent is a **private, self-hosted personal AI assistant** with:
- strong operator control (approvals + policy)
- transparency (action timeline + audit logs)
- power (tools, nodes, extensions) without silent autonomy

Tagline options:
- “Your AI. Your rules.”
- “Powerful automation, with you in control.”
- “Everything the agent does is visible — and approvable.”

## Visual identity

### Primary motif: “irresistible personal assistant” avatar

Requirement: a **sexy, confident adult woman** as the brand/avatar for the assistant.

**Safety constraints for all artwork:**
- Depict an **adult (25+)** only.
- **Non-explicit**: no nudity, no visible nipples/genitals, no explicit sex acts.
- Tasteful styling: “glamour / fashion editorial” is okay; pornographic styling is not.
- Avoid school uniforms, “teen” cues, childlike proportions, or any ambiguity.

### Art direction

- Style: high-end, modern, minimal; “luxury assistant” vibe.
- Outfit: elegant (e.g., fitted blazer + skirt, cocktail dress, sleek bodysuit under jacket) — but fully covered.
- Pose: confident, slightly flirtatious, inviting; no explicit pose.
- Background: dark gradient + soft rim lighting; subtle circuitry / AI motif.
- Color system:
  - Primary: near-black background with neon accent (cyan/purple) for “AI glow”
  - Secondary: neutral grays + warm skin tones
- Logo: wordmark “OpenAgent” with a clean geometric sans font.
