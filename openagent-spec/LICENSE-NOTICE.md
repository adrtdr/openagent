# License / Attribution Notice

## OpenAgent upstream

Your requested implementation path **forks OpenAgent** as the baseline.

OpenAgent is published under the **MIT License** (see upstream repo `LICENSE`), which generally allows
forking, modification, and redistribution **as long as you preserve the license text and copyright notice**.

**OpenAgent MUST:**

- keep the upstream MIT license and required attributions in the fork (and any distributed binaries)
- preserve third-party dependency notices where required
- document what was changed (recommended: a `NOTICE.md` + `CHANGELOG.md` in the fork)

## This spec pack

This archive contains **original specifications** (design + schemas + implementation prompts).
It does not include OpenAgent source code.

If you copy any upstream code into a new repository, treat that output as a derivative of OpenAgent
and comply with the MIT license requirements accordingly.
